<h1 style="text-align: center;">JADE (Java Agent Development Framework)</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Jade is a deprecated and truly terrible framework, but I had it in college so there it is</h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>

Jade is a framework for developing multi-agent systems in Java. However, it's important to note that JADE has long been surpassed by more modern and efficient technologies. While it may have been a part of your college curriculum, it's essential to consider why you might want to avoid investing your time in learning JADE.

## Why Not to Learn JADE
- **Outdated Technology:** JADE was created in a time when Java was the go-to language for developing multi-agent systems. However, the field has evolved significantly since then, and newer technologies have emerged that are more capable and efficient.
- **Limited Industry Relevance:** In today's software development landscape, JADE has very limited relevance. Most companies and projects have moved on to more modern and practical solutions for building distributed and intelligent systems.
- **Steep Learning Curve:** JADE's architecture and concepts can be challenging to grasp, especially for newcomers. Learning JADE may not provide you with skills that are directly transferable to modern software development.- 
- **Sparse Documentation:** Finding up-to-date and comprehensive resources for learning JADE is almost impossible. This makes it even more impractical for those looking to gain expertise in multi-agent systems.
- **Better Alternatives:** There are more robust and relevant frameworks available today for developing multi-agent systems, such as Python's MAS (Multi-Agent System) framework, which offers a more modern and user-friendly approach.
